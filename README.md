The permaculture web project is designed to help people create their own permacultural crop fields and gardens.

Made with üçì by Matias, Brice and Maxime.

Permaculture Basics:

1. Observation: Before planning anything, it is important to observe nature and the environment in which you wish to create your permaculture garden. This observation must be regular to allow to understand the natural cycles and the interactions between the various elements.

2. Planning: Once you have a good understanding of your environment, you can begin to plan your permaculture garden. This may include designing growing systems, selecting plants and animals, and planning structural elements such as paths and ponds.

3. Use of Natural Resources: Permaculture encourages the use of natural resources such as water, sun and wind to reduce environmental and economic impact. For example, rainwater can be collected and used to irrigate crops, while sunlight can be used to heat greenhouses.

4. Biodiversity arrangement: Permaculture encourages the arrangement of biodiversity in gardens. This means that plants, animals and insects should be selected for their ability to work together to create a healthy and resilient system.

5. Zone Use: Permaculture uses a zoning system to determine the location of different elements in the garden. Items requiring the most human attention, such as vegetable crops, are placed close to the house, while items requiring less attention, such as fruit trees, are placed further away.

6. Sustainable Growing Techniques: Permaculture encourages the use of sustainable growing techniques, such as mounding, companion planting, crop rotation and the use of compost to enrich the soil.

7. Spiral Design: Permaculture often uses a spiral design to create systems that mimic nature. This design maximizes the use of space and creates efficient and resilient systems.

These are the basics of permaculture, there is of course much more to learn and explore if you are interested in this practice.
